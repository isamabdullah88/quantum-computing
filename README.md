# quantum-computing
This repository contains simple code implementation of some basic but fundamental quantum algorithms using qiskit library provided by IBM. Some algorithms are simulated on actual IBM quantum computers. This repo will be updated with more algorithm implementations as I learn more about quantum algorithms.

## Environment Setup
The implementation are in python, so you first need following:
```
python
pip
virtualenv
```
Once you've installed these on your system, spawn and activate a virtual environment using this command:
```
virtualenv -p python .venv
source ./venv/bin/activate
```
Next, install following libraries:
```
pip install qiskit
pip install qiskit_aer
pip install qiskit_ibm_runtime
pip install pylatexenc
pip install matplotlib
pip install notebook
```
Now you're ready to run the quantum algorithms in the notebooks.
